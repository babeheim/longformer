add a few clean_text tests
figure out if i need review_cases or not...??
figure out if apply_id_updates makes sense...no it does not

what happens if update_id_changes is longer than 1


update_id_changes should complain if the old_id and active_id both already exist

cdm...permanent name separators or no?
